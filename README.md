## üìö Topics Covered

### üß© Computer Architecture & Digital Logic
- **Fundamentals of Computer Organization:**  
  Components of a computer, the Von Neumann model, historical evolution.
- **Data Representation:**  
  Conversion between bases, signed integers, floating-point representation.
- **Digital Logic & Circuits:**  
  Boolean algebra, logic gates, combinatorial and sequential circuits, registers, and memory construction.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Operating Systems & Process Management
- **OS Fundamentals:**  
  History, types, and roles of operating systems in resource management.
- **Process Management:**  
  Process states, scheduling, inter-process communication, and synchronization.
- **Memory Management & File Systems:**  
  Memory hierarchy, cache, virtual memory, secondary storage, and file system organization.
- **Virtualization & Administration:**  
  Installation, configuration, and management of OS in virtual machines, with logs and bit√°coras.
- **Scripting & Automation:**  
  Shell scripting in Linux and process automation.

### üêç Python Exercises for Binary Operations

## üìÅ What's Inside?

- **Labs & Practice Arenas:**  
  Hands-on experiments with virtual machine setups, process state simulations, and OS configuration. Detailed logs (bit√°coras) for each VM platform are provided.
  
- **Readings & Theoretical Materials:**  
  Slides, PDFs, and notes covering topics from digital logic and computer architecture to operating system principles and process management.
  
- **Projects:**  
  Real-world projects that simulate aspects of OS behavior and system operations.  
  - Exercises include simulations of process states, scheduling, and memory management.
  - Python scripts for binary arithmetic operations (complement calculations, base conversions, binary addition).

- **Additional Resources:**  
  Curated content and references to improve your grasp on both hardware and software aspects of computing.

## üß∞ Tech Stack & Tools

- **Virtual Machines:**  
  Platforms for installing and configuring Linux and Windows operating systems to have Solaris, Windows Server(GUI, without GUI) and Slackware VMs, using Virtual Box and VMWare Workstation Pro.
- **Shell Scripting, and Python:**
  Different shells to program into Solaris and Windows Server environments, and Python codes to solve binary problems.  
- **Supplementary Software:**  
  Tools for digital logic simulation and circuit design (e.g., Logisim, MARIE, Nand2Tetris).
